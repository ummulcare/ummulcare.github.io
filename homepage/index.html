        <h2>Welcome to my Write My New York webpage.</h2>
        <p>My name is Ummul and today, we will be learning a little more about me and what I enjoy doing. Something that you might not know is that I am a hodophile meaning I love travelling. I really love traveling and visiting new contries because I get to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>enjoy the scenery/location</li>
          <li>immerse myself in the countries' culture</li>
          <li>relax, be stress-free, and make wonderful memories</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With this being said, I will be talking about the airport that I constantly fly in and out of, JFK. JFK is my preferred airport as it is approximately a 20 minute drive from my house and also happens to be the only airport in NYC that has proven its reliabiity in regards to making sure I am able to leave the city. NYC has always been my home but because I often crave vacations, I felt as though it was only right to write about how JFK is <a href="essay.html">my New York</a>.</p>
        <p>In the <a href="pictures.html">Pictures</a> Section of my website, you will be able to see a couple of pictures I have taken in the sky!</p>
        <p>For now, I hope you get a glimpse of who I am so sit back and enjoy. Thank you :)</p>
