        <h2>International Airport of John F. Kennedy</h2>
        <p>When you first arrive at JFK, the adrenaline and excitement feels everlasting until you enter the terminal. Greeted by the information board with your flight information, there you are with other aspiring passengers. You look over to the scales and see a family trying to distribute items from a 34kg, overweight, suitcase into others that are already 23kg. Hearing “it’s alright, the worker will allow it to pass” when in reality, no one is going to let 25kg pass. Walking to your check-in desk while stumbling over little kids running around followed by their parents. Continuing towards check-in, where you see long lines of passengers on one side and supervisors and workers discussing on the other, fingers crossed that check-in for you will be fast and efficient. Fortunately for you, JFK is JFK and your line is just as long, maybe longer. Getting to the front of the line, handing your passport, itinerary, and vaccination card over to a stunning airline agent.</p>
        <p>Finish checking in when you see the big M sign of McDonalds. The $15 small six piece mcnugget meal, overpriced yet delicious. You eat your food, use the bathroom, and then go through security scanners.</p>
        <p>“Shoes and belts off. Electronics in their own trays. Jackets and sweaters off. No liquids. Passport and boarding passes in your hand. STEP DOWN, thank you.” Standing miles back from the front yet traumatized by the lingering smelly feet and loud, aggressive TSA workers. You wish you were earlier but still have two more hours to board. Finally passing through the body scanners and it rings. If you’re like me, you exit the scanner and are greeted by a full body pat down. Rubbing my head covered with a black hijab, squeezing my balled up hair, patting around my upper body, and finally rubbing down my legs. Verifying that I am not carrying any foreign substances on my body, I pass through and collect my belongings.</p>
        <p>The various eau de parfum scents linger around greeting all the passengers, the big bags of candy welcome the children, and the “I love New York” accessories attract the tourists. You walk by all the little stores with overpriced snacks and beverages. Finally, you make it to your gate where the cabin crew are welcoming the passengers to board. People start rushing, suitcases twisted and moving towards the line, and people leaving their messes where they were sitting. Seated in the back of the airplane, you decide to sit down. Unfortunately there’s a mess of popcorn left by a six year old whose family gets priority boarding. Minutes later, you too, join the last few people to board the plane. Barely expecting it, it's bye-bye New York City.</p>
        <p>You’re feets in the air looking at the beautiful houses in Long Island when you see other planes taking off from JFK. Approaching JFK overhead, the descent starts and you start feeling butterflies in your stomach. Babies crying and little kids squealing with enjoyment. Finally descended and in taxi. From the forward camera, you see the marshaller guiding the pilot. Out the window, ramp agents were preparing to unload our luggage to be sent to the terminal. Looking around, everyone was smiling after clapping in unison. Children waving to the workers outside the plane and people rushing to get their carry-ons out of the overhead bins. “Welcome to New York City, the time is now fifteen minutes to three o’clock, and we thank you for boarding Saudi Airlines. We wish a safe journey to those in transit and welcome those to their final destination, back home. Have an excellent rest of your day. We hope to see you again soon”. Disembarking with other planes, we make our way to Immigration and Customs. Noticing the “No Photos or Videos” and “Welcome to JFK” signs, it felt nice to be back home. The US was finally open to visitors so despite the US Citizens and Canadian Visitor lines being long, the Foreign Nationals and Visas were longer. Thankfully, we signed up for Mobile Passport and were able to skip the ridiculously long lines. The Border Control agent welcomed us back home, once again.</p>
        <p>Passed through passport control and walked to Baggage Claim where our luggages had yet to come out. My mother was sitting down on WhatsApp while I made my way to wait for our four suitcases. Thirty minutes went by and 5L boxes of ZamZam water started pouring out. The K-9 came out doing tours with little kids trying to pet it and Path workers did laps to be accessible for people concerned about their luggage. Suitcases, probably filled with ZamZam, start pouring out after another forty-five minutes. Annoyed passengers started easing up while chasing their suitcases. Our suitcases finally came out as my backache progressed from carrying APUSH homework in my pink NIKE bookbag. Walking towards the exits, I turn around once more. The K-9 makes another round and I smile knowing I’ll be back soon.</p>
        <p>Exiting the terminal to see taxis lined up, families waiting, and birds leaving too. It’s nice to be home.</p>
